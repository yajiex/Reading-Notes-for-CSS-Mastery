# Chapter 3: Visual Formatting Model Overview
* If you add a `background` to an element, it will be applied to the area formed by the content and padding.
* CSS 2.1 also contains the `outline` property. Unlike the border property, outlines are drawn over the top of an element's box, so they don't affect its size or positioning. Because of this, outlines can be useful when fixing bugs, because they won't alter the layout of your page.
