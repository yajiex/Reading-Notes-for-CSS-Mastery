# Chapter 4: Using Backgrounds for Effect
* The default browser behavior is to repeat background images horizontally and vertically so that the image tiles across the whole of the page.
* Background images always sit on the top of the background color
* If you set a vertical and horizontal position of 20 percent, you are actually positioning a point 20 percent from the top left of the image, 20 percent from the top left of the parent element
* The `border-image` property will automatically use the images in each sector for the corresponding border.
* `box-shadow` property takes four values: the vertical and horizontal offsets, the width (and hence blurriness) of the shadow, and the color. It works in conjunction with the `border-radius` property
* The one big problem with CSS `opacity` is that it's inherited by the contents of the element you're applying it to, as well as the background.
* RGBa is a mechanism for setting color and opacity in one go. The last number is the decimal value of opacity, so 0.8 means this background will be 80 percent opaque, or to put it another way, 20 percent transparent. A value of 1 would make the alert 100 percent opaque, while a value of 0 would make it fully transparent.
