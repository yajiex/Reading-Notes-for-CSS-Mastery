# 1 Setting the Foundations
* A document type definition (DTD) is a set of machine-readable rules that define what is and isn't allowed in a particular version of HTML or XML. Browsers are supposed to use these rules when parsing a web page to check the validity of the page and act accordingly. Browsers know which DTD to use, and hence which version of HTML you are using, by analyzing the page's DOCTYPE declaration.
* A DOCTYPE declaration is a line or two of code at the start of your HTML document that describes the particular DTD being used.
